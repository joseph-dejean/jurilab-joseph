## 📊 Real Timing

| Scenario | Time to Transcript | Frequency |
|----------|-------------------|-----------|
| **Super fast** | 2-5 minutes | Rare ⭐ |
| **Normal** | 5-10 minutes | Most common ✅ |
| **Slower** | 10-15 minutes | Sometimes ⏰ |
| **Account issue** | Never | Check Daily.co account ⚠️ |

---

## 🎯 What You Do

### Old Way:
```
❌ Wait 15 min → Go check → Maybe it's there → Maybe not
```

### New Way:
```
✅ End call → Walk away → System auto-checks every 2 min → Transcript appears!
```

**Zero manual work!** 🎉

---

## 💡 Why the Variation?

Daily.co needs to:
1. Save audio recording (1-2 min)
2. Process speech-to-text (3-5 min)  
3. Make available via API (varies)

**Total: Usually 5-10 minutes, max 15 minutes**

Our system checks **every 2 minutes** so you get it as soon as Daily.co finishes!
